## Lyrics

```
got dark fam still ops ready, juicing for some bangers
brought into false prophets, doubt it'll ever make me panic
purify the stand in reasons, cure, it has been helpful
see religion is not my thing but sure this shit's my temple

(i) ran through all the tasks, i've been mission-taught and selfless
former priests of cult they were enemies but reckless (taken) 
i go ponder hidden schemes of all the timeless symbols
i don't sleep too much these days so all my nights are endless

stacks of layers, concept doubling into former thoughts

made it through too fearless streaks with their creative roles

if i'd've been so focused on the peak

visions come from dreams or blurs, they aren't (not) for the weak

if they say we voice so radical they should call the swat / cops

```
